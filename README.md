# Tasks

## Prompt
>Project Idea: Task Management Application
>
>Create a simple task management application that allows users to add, update, and track tasks. The application should have the following functionalities:
>
>Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
>
>Task List: Display a list of all tasks with their details (title, description, due date, etc.).
>
>Task Update: Users can update task details such as the title, description, or due date.
>
>Task Completion: Implement a feature to mark tasks as completed.
>
>Task Filtering: Provide options to filter tasks based on completion status or due date.
>
>Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
>
>Save and Load Data: Implement data persistence to save tasks to a file so that users can access them even after restarting the application.
>
>User Interface: Create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the application. You can use Java Swing or JavaFX for this purpose.
